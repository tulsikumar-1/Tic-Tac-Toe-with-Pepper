# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Pepper
<br />
A tic-tac-toe-playing robot is built with a pepper robot. The robot is programmed to show empathy and also arrogance depending upon the user’s moves. Pepper is programmed to play two types of games i.e. 3x3 and 4x4. 
<br />
The plan for the robot to play the game against the user is generated using non-deterministic game playing and the robot has successive moves for the creation of the game plan. The planner used is Safe Planner. The planner is saved in a JSON file as well for offline usage because it is not feasible to find the ideal move at runtime. The robot shows impatient behavior as well just like the humans when the human doesn’t play the game or is late in filling in the grid with the marker.
<br />
The robot checks the human mood, if the human is happy then it plays the best move otherwise only random moves are played.
<br />
This project combines HRI and RA to provide a formidable robot.
